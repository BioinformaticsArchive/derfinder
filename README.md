DER Finder
=========

This is the beta version of the R package for DER Finder, a method for analyzing differential expression with RNA-seq data.  DER Finder is described in detail in the paper [Differential expression analysis of RNA-seq data at single-base resolution](http://biostatistics.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2014/01/06/biostatistics.kxt053.full). Code for the analysis used in the paper is in `analysis_code.R`.  Other scripts related to this analysis will be added to this repo ASAP.

The release version of this R package can be found at https://github.com/lcolladotor/derfinder. We also plan to submit the package to [Bioconductor](http://bioconductor.org/).
